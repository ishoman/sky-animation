# _Sky Animation_

#### _Sunset/Sunrise looping animation_

## Description

_Styled and created on our second day of practice using CSS animations. I chose this as a way of experimenting with running multiple animations that needed to be synced up (sky darkening with sun setting, etc.). I also hadn't previously spent much time working with the absolute/relative positioning in CSS so I had fun with this.
